This repo aims to learn how to develop and test an asynchronous API with FastAPI, Postgres, pytest and Docker using Test-driven Development (TDD). We'll also use the Databases package for interacting with Postgres asynchronously.

#Dependencies:

FastAPI v0.88.0
Docker v20.10.21
Python v3.11.0
pytest v7.2.0
Databases v0.6.2
#Objectives

* Develop an asynchronous RESTful API with Python and FastAPI
* Practice Test-driven Development
* Test a FastAPI app with pytest
* Interact with a Postgres database asynchronously
* Containerize FastAPI and Postgres inside a Docker container
* Parameterize test functions and mock functionality in tests with pytest
* Document a RESTful API with Swagger/OpenAPI
